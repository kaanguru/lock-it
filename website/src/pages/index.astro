          " One of the main benefits of PWAs with local storage is the ability to provide offline functionality. PWAs can store data in the local storage of the user's device, allowing the app to load previously stored data even when the user is not connected to the internet. This enables the app to function seamlessly even in poor network conditions",

        title: '2. Improved Performance',

          ' By utilizing local storage, PWAs can improve performance by reducing reliance on the network connection. Traditional websites heavily rely on the network connection to fetch data, which can result in slower loading times. With local storage, PWAs can store frequently accessed data locally, reducing the need for repeated network requests and improving overall performance',

The browser will retain the data as long as possible and provide a way for the user to manually remove some data if necessary.",
